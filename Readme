This is a port of the original BMP to YJK converter ver0.2 created by buppu. 

I have to admit porting the program was more or less by accident. For some reason I thought I was porting a utility for the EVA format, but I only discovered my mistake when testing... 
However, I desided to finish up and make the port available is anyone can use it. But I guess the audience is more or less limited to retro MSX enthusiasts ;)

All credits go to buppu for the original code. My work is limited to liberating the code from any windows depency so it can be compiled on modern *NIX platforms. I have tested it with MacOS (M1) and Debian (Arm64)

The original documentation is in japanese, so the help text is rather limited.
